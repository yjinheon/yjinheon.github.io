# Data Engineering

Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of processes and systems that ingest raw data and produce high quality and consistent data to be used for analysis
, machine learning, and more.
As a data engineer, you must incorporate security, data management, orchestration, data architecture, software engineering
, and operations to manage the lifecycle of data.
The goal is to take raw data and make it easy and reliable to work with and to integrate across datasets and domains.
To accomplish this goal, you use methods, tools, and services such as streaming, extract, transform, and load, or ETL, data warehouses, and data lakes.


# Domain 1 Data Ingestion and Transformation

Throughput and latency

## 1.1 Performing Data ingestion

### Data engineering life cycle

Generation -> Storage -> Ingestion -> Transformation -> Serving

#### Generation

### Ingestion

Ingestion: data ingestion is moving data from one place to another.

- Gather and Ingest data
- Batch and stream
- Push and Pull

#### Data Ingestion pipelines

- Reprocess
  : S3, Amazon Kinesis, Amazon EventBridge
- Idempotent
- Checkpoints
- Versioning
- Compliance and governance
- Logging and Monitoring
- Tools

#### Transactional Data

- Dynamo DB
- Amazon RDS
- AWS DataBase Migration Service (AWS DMS)

#### Streaming Data

- Kinesis
  - Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
  - Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
  - Amazon Kinesis Vides Streams
- Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink
